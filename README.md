**Tic-tac-toe**, **noughts and crosses**, or **Xs and Os** is a 2 player game.
In this game players take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

- **Note**: There is no universally-agreed rule as to who plays first, but in this article the convention that X plays first is used. 

## Gameplay
Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid. 
In the following example, the first player (X) wins the game in seven steps:
